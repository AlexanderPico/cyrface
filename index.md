# Cyrface documentation

Cyrface establishes an interface between R and Cytoscape by using different Java-R libraries, e.g. [Rserve](http://www.rforge.net/Rserve/), [RCaller](http://www.mhsatman.com/rcaller.php). Cyrface can be used as a Cytoscape plug-in, e.g. to run R commands within Cytoscape, or used as a library to allow your plug-in to connect to R.
