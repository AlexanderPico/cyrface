# GitHub Pages template for the Saez group's projects

## Purpose
GitHub allows us to create documentation websites for each repository.
In order to keep the format of these websites similar, here you can find a template.

This template defines only:

- the structure of the site,
- font type, colour, size
- background colour
- etc.

We would like to keep only the style-related code here. 
Right now, Jakob prepared a version (many thanks), but it is open for discussion. 
We can keep updating it.

You can check the current template at http://saezlab.github.io/projectDocumentationTemplate

## Github Pages in gh-pages branch
Github Pages let us create website for the group/organisation (saezlab.github.io) and 
also for each project (see for example http://saezlab.github.io/PHONEMeS/).

There are basically 3 ways to generate the website for a project. The simplest is to keep 
the website specific content in a branch, called gh-pages (the name is important and defined by GitHub). 
The admins of the Saezlab can turn on the Pages feature via Settings/GitHub Pages -> Source: gh-pages branch. 

## How to
In case you are developing a tool, let's say KinAct, you can do the following steps to have the template:

- open a terminal and go to project's folder
